### How it works

**Adding companies**

Add user in the WP Dashboard with the Exhibitor group.

**Modifying companies information**

If you are an admin, you can do it in the user's settings
If you are a company, log in with you account and you will be redirected to your Trade Fair Profile. From there you can modify your informations.

**Modifying Trade Fair Data**

Go to the WP Dashboard and in the Trade Fair section. Make your changes and press save.

### Installation


### Suggested plugins

Here are some plugins to improve/complete the Trade Fair plugin:

- [WP Users Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-users-media/): give each user it's media folder. Go to settings and enable it for only the Exhibitor group.
- [Loco translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/): French and English are available, but you can translate the plugin in more languages. Feel free to add your translations to the repo.
- [Loginer](https://fr-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/loginer-custom-login-page-builder/): Customise your login page. You can disable Dashboard bar by going to Loginer > settings > General and add the Exhibitor group in the Restrict User From Dashboard 

### Customisation

You can customise the colors in the trade fair profile by setting css variable. Current css variables are:

--tf-accent-color

The current css is very light. You can easily modify the appearance by overriding the css in your theme's css or by cloning the project.
