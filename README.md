## Documentation

### How it works

**Adding companies**

Add user in the WP Dashboard with the Exhibitor group.

**Modifying companies information**

If you are an admin, you can do it in the user's settings.
If you are a company, log in with you account and you will be redirected to your Trade Fair Profile. From there you can modify your information. The plugin creates a new endpoint at yoursite.com/trade-fair-profile.

**Modifying Trade Fair Data**

Go to the WP Dashboard and in the Trade Fair section. Make your changes and press save.

**Displaying companies**

To display the companies you can use the Gutenberg Block if your theme supports Gentenberg.
You can also use the shortcode ```[tf-companies n_cols=3]```. The n_cols argument is used to specify the number of columns. Supported values are 1 to 4.

### Installation

Upload the released folder using FTP or the zipped version using the dashboard.

N.B: I don't know why, but on some installations the exhibitor role has to have the delete_users permission to be able to see and upload images in the Trade Fair Profile section.

### Suggested plugins

Here are some plugins to improve/complete the Trade Fair plugin:

- [WP Users Media](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-users-media/): give each user it's media folder. Go to settings and enable it for only the Exhibitor group.
- [Loco translate](https://wordpress.org/plugins/loco-translate/): French and English are available, but you can translate the plugin in more languages. Feel free to add your translations to the repo.
- [Loginer](https://fr-ca.wordpress.org/plugins/loginer-custom-login-page-builder/): Customise your login page. You can disable Dashboard bar by going to Loginer > settings > General and add the Exhibitor group in the Restrict User From Dashboard 

### Customisation

You can customise the colors in the trade fair profile by setting css variable. Current css variables are:

--tf-accent-color

The current css is very light. You can easily modify the appearance by overriding the css in your theme's css or by cloning the project.
